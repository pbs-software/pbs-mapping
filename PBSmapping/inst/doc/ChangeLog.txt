--------------------------------------------------

2.74.2 (2025-06-10) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * R code
    + Updated function `addCompass' to use the latest geomagnetic declinations out to 2030 (RH 241219)
    + Made numerous changes to code layout in `PBSmapping.r' (RH 241220)
    + Added `Magnetic-Poles.xlsx' to doucumentation folder (not R package) (RH 250610)

2.74.1 (2024-09-25) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * Documentation
    + Removed offending (forbidden) hyperlink from `addBubbles.Rd' (RH 240925)
    + Added `dot-create.Rd' to repo (not sure how its absence passed the check in the first place) (RH 240925)

2.74.0 (2024-09-24) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * Documentation
    + Passes tests on Github using workflow `R-CMD-check.yaml' (RH 240924)
      - (i) macos-latest, (ii) windows-latest (release), (iii) ubuntu-latest (devel), (iv) ubuntu-latest (release), (v) ubuntu-latest (oldrel-1)
    + Cannot find a way to check package on all operating systems using SVN
      - Equivalent in Gitub is : pbs-mapping/.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml

2.73.8 (2024-09-17) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * Documentation
    + Attempt to add a path containing `pdflatex' onto path for Sweave vignette. (RH 240909)
      - various attempts but Rhub still craps out on missing 'pdflatex'
    + Adding R code into Rnw vignette raised another issue about missing tangle (RH 240916)
      + Followed example of package `gglasso' by adding Rnw, R and PDF into `inst/doc' directory

2.73.7 (2024-09-05) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * C code
    + Managed to see the PBR error message running the R-devel check on Linux with the help of CG (RH 240905)
      - CG update the Linux C-compiler : upgraded gcc and g++ from 11.4.0 to version 14.1.0
      - CG had to build it from source to do so on this OS : compiler compiled using flex and yacc (bison)
    + Changed `clipperWrapper' code
      - changing `#include <Rdefines.h>' to `#include <Rinternals.h>' did not work
      - adding `#include <Rinternals.h>' before `#include <Rdefines.h>' did not work
      - changed `mkChar' to `Rf_mkChar', `classgets' to `Rf_classgets', and `error' to `perror' as per suggestions in `00install.out' report.
      - ran `.PBSfigs()' in R-devel for Windows 10 Enterprise 22H2 and Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (aka Jammy Jellyfish) without errors.

2.73.6 (2024-09-03) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=F]
  * C code
    + Issue from CRAN is causing problems (but of course it does not show up in local checks)
      - Compilation fails when using _R_CXX_USE_NO_REMAP_=true, which compiles C++ code with R_NO_REMAP defined;
      - See chapter `The R API: entry points for C code' in `Writing R Extensions' for more information.
    + Tried various tweaks to see the issue that PBR sees:
      - set environmental variable _R_CXX_USE_NO_REMAP_=true globally and in RdevCheck.bat : no change
      - set R_Tools=%R_Base%\Rtools44 in RdevCheck.bat (had been demoted to Rtools42 for rstan conniptions a while back) : no change
  * Documentation
    + Fixed a number of Rd issues seen by Rdevcheck (RH 240903)
    + Updated short vignette to fix a broken hyperlink (RH 240904)

2.73.5 (2024-04-11) [Rcheck=F, Rbuild=F]
  * Documentation
    + Repatriated dot functions (no longer banished to the namespace nether region); new documentation files:
      - `dot-validate.Rd' for `.validate' auxiliary functions (RH 240311)
      - `dot-add.Rd' for `.add' auxiliary functions (RH 240311)
      - `dot-fix.Rd' for `.fix' auxiliary functions (RH 240321)
      - `dot-calc.Rd' for `.calc' auxiliary functions (RH 240321)
      - `dot-get.Rd' for `.get' auxiliary functions (RH 240325)
      - `dot-mat2df.Rd' for `.fix' auxiliary function (RH 240326)
      - `dot-check.Rd for `.check' auxiliary functions (RH 240326)
    + Inserted auxiliary (dot) functions as aliases in existing Rd file: 
      - amalgamated `clipPolys', `clipLines', and `.clip' in `clipPolys.Rd' (RH 240321)
      - added `.closestPoint' to `calcConvexHull.Rd' (RH 240325)
      - added `.expandEdges' to `calcVoronoi.Rd' (RH 240325)
      - added `.plotMaps' and `.initPlotRegion' to `plotMap.Rd' (RH 240325)
      - added `.insertNAs' and `.rollupPolys' to `addPolys.Rd' (RH 240326)
      - added `.insertNAs', `.preparePolyProps', and `.rollupPolys' to `addPolys.Rd' (RH 240326)

2.73.4 (2023-11-03) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T, CRAN version]
  * Documentation
    + Fixed broken URL in `addBubbles.Rd' (thanks UW)
    + Finished the history of changes in the `ChangeLog.txt' file.

2.73.3 (2023-10-30) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * Documentation
    + Added Rd documentation files for .PBmapEnv and a few functions. (RH 231030)
    + Updated Rd files with NB's new particulars.
  * R code
    + Removed (temporarily) function `importShapefile' until/if RB's C code can be incorporated into PBSmapping. (RH 231027)

2.73.2 (2022-09-06) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * Documentation
    + Updated `calcArea.Rd' and `convUL.Rd' so that `\emph' does not appear in math rendering.

2.73.1 (2022-07-12) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * R code
    + Modified R function `.addBubblesLegend' to satisfy CRAN
      - From : if (class(legend.pos) == "numeric") {
      - To   : if (inherits(legend.pos, "numeric")) {
  * C code
    + Modified `clipperWrapper' to bring Sint and Sfloat into scope.
      - moved `typedef int Sint; typedef double Sfloat;' from `clipperWrapper.cpp' to `clipperWrapper.h'
    + Updated copyright dates in PBSmapping C source files.
  * Documentation
    + Updated a few Rd files with broken hyperlinks to Internet addresses.

2.73.0 (2021-01-11) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * R code
    + Modified function `addBubbles' to accept negative data values. (RH 210111)
    + Added new functions `RGB2RYB' and `RYB2RGB' based on the equations in Sugita and Takahashi (2015,2017). (RH 210106)
      - Converts between the Red-Green-Blue and Red-Yellow-Blue colour schemes.
    + Modified function `addCompass' to include magnetic pole positions from the NOAA's IGRF-13 model (1900-2025). (RH 210104)

2.72.1 (2019-03-14) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * C code
    + Removed 'undeclared' SEXP variables from `importGSHHS' (see below) because they had been defined on lines 62:63. (RH 190314)
      - RH fumbling around in C lead to R crashing when importGSHHS() was called.
    + Changed the PROTECT and UNPROTECT calls in `clipperWrapper.cpp' and `convGSHHS.c'. (RH 190313)
      - Disabled 'protectCount' in `clipperWrapper.cpp' because CRAN's rchk cannot determine whether stacks are imbalanced.
      - Added undeclared SEXP variables to function `importGSHHS' in `convGSHHS.c'.
      - Updated copyright date ranges in relevant C files.
  * R code
    + Modified function `refocusWorld' for datasets that don't extend into Antaractica, e.g. borders (RH 190314)
      - Added line 'if (any(is.Ant)) {' before processing polygons with >100 vertices that lie south of -60 degrees latitude.
    + Changed `is.na()' to `all(is.na())' in function addBubbles. (RH 190313)
      - Rdevcheck choked on this example, but this may be only because it is the first example and there is another issue.
    + Modified function `makeGrid' to create hexagons in a pattern consistent with that of rectangles. (RH 190104)
      - If argument `byrow=T', rectangles and hexagons have PIDs that increment by column, otherwise by row.
      - Changed default value of argument `type' from `square' to `rectangle'.

2.72.0 (2018-11-23) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * R code
    + Modified function `makeGrid' to alternatively construct a regular hexagonal tesselation. (RH 181120)
      - Default: type='square'; alternative: type='hexagon'; no triangular tesselation at present.
      - The hexagonal grid can either be by row (pointy topped) or by column (flat topped).
    + Add new functions `rotatePolys' and `rotateEvents' to rotate maps clockwise. (RH 181115)
      - Suggestion from one of the reviewers of the Redstripe Rockfish assessment.
      - Spurred by implementation of ggplot's annoying ability to rotate maps in PBS groundfish package `gfsynopsis'.

2.71.1 (2018-10-26) [Rcheck=F, Rbuild=F]
  * R code
    + Modified function `refocusWorld' (RH 181026)
      - Added in new code to detect Antarctica, expand it, and clip it.

2.71.0 (2018-09-07) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=F]
  * R code
    + Modified function `.validateData' (RH 180910)
      - Keys created from > 2 columns (e.g., PID, SID, POS) were no longer being created properly.
      - Orphaned hole check now only occurs if `polys' is actually a PolySet.
    + Modified function 'importShapefile' to use the modified function 'placeHoles', if called to do so. (RH 180906)
    + Modified function '.is.in' to report when all points lies on a boundary (RH 180906)
      - There are holes is some solids that exactly define solids elsewhere.
    + Modified function `placeHoles' in 'extraCode.r' (RH 180906)
      - This function was using '.calcOrientation' inappropriately sometimes because
      -   PBSmapping outer contours (solids) and inner contours (holes) do not rely on 
      -   GIS standards of clockwise or counterclockwise tracing to determine the contour type.
      - Modified function can now use either the orientation method or behaviour documented 
      -   in the User's Guide: solids have POS increasing, holes have POS decreasing.
    + Promoted 'is.in' subfunction to a hidden dot function usable by all functions. (RH 180828)
      - The function now uses the PBSmapping C function 'findPolys' rather than relying on sp::point.in.polygon.
    + Modified function '.validateData' to check for orphaned holes and to notify the user of their existence. (RH 180828)
      - Issue arose when user Uli brought to light a set of polygons with 1 solid followed by 5 holes completely outside the solid.
      - The object most likely was intended to portray 6 solids.
      - This anomalous polygon came from using Google's OpenStreetMap folowed by a call to maptools::SpatialPolygons2PolySet.
    + Separated functions into three distinct R files: (RH 180824)
      - 'PBSmapping.r' contains the original suite of documented functions (more or less) for PBSmapping.
      - 'extraFuns.r' contains any code that was added to PBSmapping after JTS and NB departed for better places.
      - 'dotFuns.r' contains all the hidden dot functions (not documented).

## Below: Functional categories for R code follow those in Table F.1 :
## -- Import, Plotting, Computational, Object-related, Data sets

2.70.5 (2018-06-05) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * Plotting
    + Added explicit argument `xpd=TRUE' to polygon commands in `.plotMaps' and `addPolys'. (RH 180605)
      - The polygon command was not filling in polygons properly on Windows devga device when going through examples in `.PBSfigs'.
  * C code
    + Changed line 721 in `clipper.cpp' from `std::memset(e, 0, sizeof(TEdge));' to `*e = { };' on the advice of NB and his C++ wizard friend. (RH 180601)
      - Response to PBR's gcc8 check:
      - clipper.cpp:721:34: warning: 'void* memset(void*, int, size_t)' clearing an object of non-trivial type 'struct ClipperLib::TEdge'; use assignment or value-initialization instead [-Wclass-memaccess]
  * Documentation
    + Changed format of ChangeLog to a standard that can be read by the function `readClog' in pkg `PBStools'. (RH 171027)
    + Replaced `index.html' with `Links.html' in ../inst/doc because R build replaces the former with its own version. (RH 171003)

2.70.4 (2017-06-28)
  * C code
    + Made changes to `init.c', 'PBSmapping.h|c', `clipperWrapper.h|cpp', `convGSHHS.c'; added new header file `convGSHHS.h'. (NB 170628)
  * Examples
    + Made minor changes to function `.PBSfigs'. (RH 170628)
  * Computational
    + Changed call in `calcVoronoi' from  `deldir::deldir' to `deldir' as it seemed to mess up the CRAN check for deldir's registered
      - Fortran calls when launched from the Rd example for `calcVoronoi'. (RH 170627)
      - The problem was not reproducible so I'm not sure what happened. 
      - Potential compatibility issue: a Windows binary for `deldir' was downloaded for R-3.2.2 Patched and used for R-devel
      - before deldir was downloaded directly through the R-devel update menu.

2.70.3 (2017-06-26)
  * C code
    + Registered C routines (new CRAN request) using RB's maptools `init.c' as a template. (NB/RH 170626)
  * Documentation
    + Updated the User's Guide to use Arial font to be more consistent with DFO CSAS and Canadian Technical Reports. (RH 170622)

2.70.2 (2017-04-10)
  * Documentation
    + Updated the User's Guide `PBSmapping-UG.pdf (RH 170410)
    + Updated the vignette `PBSmappingIntro.Rnw'. (RH 170406)
    + Changed backticks ` in DESCRIPTION to single quotes ' (Kurt Hornik 2016-09-20)
    + You need to set the BINPREF variable in etc/.../Makeconf and you can omit the ? (UL 2016-04-18)
      - Old: BINPREF ?= c:/Rtools/mingw_64/bin/
      - New: BINPREF = C:/Apps/R/Rtools/mingw_64/bin/

2.70.1 (2016-04-04)
  * Graphics
    + Added a new function `addCompass' that can add a compass rose to a map. (RH 160401)
  * Computational
    + Added a new function `calcGCdist' to calculate great-circle distance. (RH 160401)
  * Documentation
    + Updated `PBSmappingIntro.Rnw' (RH 160331)

2.70.0 (2015-08-12)
  * Documentation
    + New version format x.y.z
    + Changed 2.69 to 2.70.0

2.69  2015-04-23
  * Documentation
    + Last minute updates before another attempt to post on CRAN. (RH 150423)
  * C code
    + Addressed warning when DEBUG == 1 regarding signed/unsigned comparison. (NB 150409)
    + Removed use of the token pasting operator (##). (NB 150409)
  * Documentation
    + Modified `joinPolys.Rd' to illustrate the `DIFF' operation between polyA (A,B) and polyB (C,D). (RH 150330)
    + Updated `PBSmapping-UG.pdf' (and no longer includes Rd appendix because easily available on CRAN). (RH 150224)
    + Declared S3methods for `print' and `summary' in the NAMESPACE file, as required by CRAN. (RH 150217)
    + Updated `importGSHHS.Rd' to reflect changes made to function and to give 20 examples for various aprts of world. (RH 150216)
  * Import
    + Modified extensively `importGSHHS' to deal with various problems encountered by users (wrapping, border problems, etc.). (RH 150212)
  * Computational
    + Modified `refocusWorld' to return the `xlim' used in the refocus as an attribute called `rf.xlim' (for use in `importGSHHS'). (RH 150211)
  * C code
    + Updated Clipper to 6.2.1 and added (disabled) dbg output to clipperWrapper.cpp. (NB 150207)
      - We received a bug report regarding joinPolys.  After significant testing/tracing, the bug appears to exist within Clipper 5.1.6.
      - Rather than revert to 5.1.4, this commit upgrades Clipper to 6.2.1.
  * Documentation
    + Bumped up version for next posting to CRAN in 2015.

2.68  2015-01-22
  * Documentation
    + Fixed some broken hyperlinks and merged `nepacLL.Rd', `nepacLLhigh.Rd', `worldLL.Rd', and `worldLLhigh.Rd' into `nepacLL.Rd' using aliases. (RH 150122)
    + Ignored R CMD check: ``... used in a situation where it does not exist'' -- identified as a temporary bug in R-devel by Duncan Murdoch:
      - http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/R-CMD-check-quot-quot-used-in-a-situation-where-it-does-not-exist-td4701779.html
    + Resolved missing line feed in `Makefile'; converted format from DOS to UNIX for `Makefile' and `*.cpp' files in `/inst/Utils'. (NB 150114)
  * C code
    + Eliminated warning when compiling `clipper.cpp'. (NB 150112)
      - Commented out an unused variable declared within `clipper.cpp'. This commit turns that declaration into a comment to eliminate the warning.
    + Updated clipper library from 5.1.4 to 5.1.6. (NB 150109)
    + Added `SystemRequirements: C++11' to the DESCRIPTION file to alert user that compilation and linking should be done with a C++11 compiler. (NB 150109)
      - The clipper library used by PBSmapping operates on coordinates stored as integers, and for those integers, it uses the "long long" type that 
      - was introduced in the C++11 standard. When an R package requires C++11 features, the DESCRIPTION file must state this requirement.
  * Documentation
    + Added namespace when calling `deldir' and `read.dbf'. (NB 150109)
      - PBSmapping calls `deldir' (package deldir) and `read.dbf' (package foreign),and for each, the code now specifies the namespace.
    + Bumped up version for next posting to CRAN in 2015.

2.67  2014-12-15
  * C code
    + Changed line in `clipperWrapper.cpp' from `ulong64 val = llabs(*f++);' to `ulong64 val = (ulong64)fabs(*f++);' (NB 141217)
      - The C compiler 'clang' with -Wall reports that PBSmapping is misusing the C function abs in their code: see
      - http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Portable-C-and-C_0022_0022-code
  * Documentation
    + Added NLK and RB as authors because we use their C code `Rshapeget' for the function `importShapefile'. (RH 141217)
  * Computational
    + Added new argument `includeBdry' to functions `findCells' and `findPolys' -- see Issue 33. (RH 141215)
  * Import
    + Incorporated temporary fix for borders in function `importGSHHS' until more robust solution is found. (RH 140623)
  * Documentation
    + JTS requested that RH becomes the package Maintainer. (RH 140327)
    + Bumped up version for next posting to CRAN using builds under R-3.0.3 (RH 140320)

2.66  2014-03-10
  * Computational
    + Fixed bug in `joinPolys` identified by Andrea Romualdi (see Issue 31). (RH 140310)
  * C code
    + Modified gshhs.h to address Issue 30. (JTS 140218)
  * Import
    + Modified the function `importShapefile` to treat shape types (5,15,25) like 5, (3,13,23) like 3, and (1,11,21) like 1. (RH 131220)
      - See `ESRI Shapefile Technical Description: An ESRI White Paper-July 1998` for more details.
  * Documentation
    + Updated `PBSmapping-UG.pdf` to reflect the new website for GSHHS, now called GSHHG. (RH 130503)
    + Added Authors to DESCRIPTION file (based on C source code annotations); updated copyright dates. (RH 130503)
    + Modified User's Guide. (RH 130501)
    + Moved `PBSmapping-Intro.Rnw` to `vignettes` directory. (RH 130501)

2.65  2013-04-22
  * Plotting
    + Added temporary function `.addAxis2` to address Issue 20 until NB updates code. (RH 130422)
  * Documentation
    + Updated the User's Guide. (RH 130411)
    + Modified the `print` method to look for `.PBSmapEnv$PBSprint` in addition to a global `PBSprint`. (RH 130410)
    + Added new temporary working environment called `.PBSmapEnv`. (RH 130410)
  * Examples
    + Modified example code in Rd files to use the new environment `.PBSmapEnv`. (RH 130410)
  * C code
    + Address odd joinPolys output observed in Puget Sound. (NB 130328)
    + Updated Clipper from 5.1.3 to 5.1.4. (NB 130328)
    + Change Clipper line endings from DOS (\r\n) to UNIX (\n). (NB 130323)

2.62  2012-03-01
  * C code
    + Fixed source code problems identified by PBR. (NB 120301)
      - Compiled code should not call functions which might terminate R nor write to stdout/stderr instead of to the console.
      - The detected symbols are linked into the code but might come from libraries and not actually be called.
      - Please fix (especially the call to exit).
    + Resolved partial argument matching in functions identified by PBR. (RH 120301)
  * Documentation
    + Cleaned up various files in preparation for submission to CRAN. (RH 120229)
  * C code
    + Added further conditional compilation to gshhs.[ch] to address warnings in Windows OS. (NB 120228)
  * Import
    + Rewrote GSHHS import functionality and revised some related functions. (NB 120225)
      - This rather large commit completely rewrites GSHHS functionality and provides a number of immediate advantages:
      -   (a) support for the latest (2.20) GSHHS binary files, 
      -   (b) support for multiple levels, e.g., lakes, islands, and ponds, within a single import with suitable ordering of polygons and their holes, 
      -   (c) support for lines, e.g., rivers and borders, 
      -   (d) more robust support functions, e.g., .fixGSHHSworld, and finally, 
      -   (e) a more maintainable approach to GSHHS integration.
      - Some specific changes include:
      - (1) .fixGSHHSworld (PBSmapping.r)
      -     -> support world maps centred on 0 in addition to 180 degrees.
      - (2) importGSHHS (PBSmapping.r)
      -     -> revised arguments to support the new behaviour (above);
      -     -> process argument gshhsDB to support paths relative to home directories;
      -     -> moved handling of minVerts from R to C;
      -     -> moved clipping from C to R (to simplify C code);
      -     -> ordered PIDs/SIDs to support holes.
      - (3) convGSHHS.c
      -     -> rewrote completely so that it is distinct from gshhs.c.
      - (4) gshhs.c
      -     -> added slight revisions to support calls to routines in convGSHHS.c.
      - (5) gshhs.h
      -     -> added slight revisions to support calls to routines in convGSHHS.c.
      - (6) importGSHHS.Rd
      -     -> revised to match the changes to the code.
  * C code
    + Reduced whitespace and break long lines in 'convGSHHS.c'. (NB 120224)
  * Documentation
    + Corrected spelling mistakes in Rd documentation. (NB 120224)
  * Computational
    + Added support for S hemisphere to LL <=> UTM conversion (convUL). (NB 120224)
      - Added support for the southern hemisphere to convUL (and supporting functions) by adding a new 
      - "southern" argument.  By default, the argument is NULL because detection is automatic when the 
      - source is LL. For UTM source data, the default is FALSE because we typically work within the northern hemisphere.
      - Added the ability to compile conversions.c (the supporting C code) as a stand-alone application.  
      - When executed, the stand-alone executable performs a number of conversions that help validate the algorithm.
    + Improved long/lat <=> UTM conversions; updated documentation ( Issue #9 ). (NB 120223)
      - Issue #9  noted erroneous results given data that spanned more than one zone to the right/left 
      - of the intended central zone.  This update improves our implementation by correcting a number of 
      - (implementation) errors (described below), but the problem still persists.
      - The earlier (2001) implementation had a number of optimizations that made it terribly difficult 
      - to verify the code against the published algorithm and inspecting the implementation revealed some errors:
      - (1) the calculation of 'n' used scaled 'a'/'b' rather than original 'a'/'b',
      - (2) the calculation of 'e^2' used scaled 'a'/'b' rather than original 'a'/'b', and
      - (3) the calculation of 'm' was not iterative as suggested in the algorithm.
      - This new version more closely matches the published algorithm and is consequently easy to verify.
      - The performance is similar to the old algorithm (faster in some cases, slower in others).
  * Data sets
    + Re-compressed rda files; changed namespace to explicitly export; changed dependency to R (>= 2.10). (RH 111221)
  * Plotting
    + Fixed missing longitude/latitude X/Y labels on Mac OS X. (NB 111220)
      - When plotting a longitude/latitude PolySet on Mac OS X, the X/Y labels wouldn't plot.
      - Our earlier use of \260 for the degree sign depends on the underlying character set, so it isn't sufficiently portable.
      - Let's hope the current approach works a little better...
    + Updated .addAxis(...) to address layout(...) incompatibility. (NB 111220)
      - .addAxis(...) would backup/restore "omi" and "mfg", which would impact how layout(...) handles multiple plots.
      - This behaviour is unnecessary in the current version of R, so it has been removed.
    + Added refocusWorld() to help plot maps centred on the mid-Atlantic ( issue #4 ). (NB 111219)
      - This new function accepts a PolySet containing one or more polygons with X-coordinates that collectively span 
      - approximately 360 degrees. 
      - The function effectively joins the PolySet into a cylinder and then splits it at an arbitrary longitude according
      - to the user-specified limits.  
      - Modifications in the resulting PolySet are restricted to shifting X-coordinates by +/- multiples of 360 degrees,
      - and instead of clipping polygons, the return value simply omits out-of-range polygons.
    + Fixed indenting. (NB 111219)
  * Documentation
    + Clarified use of "latter" on page 13 of UG (issue #10). (NB 111214)
      - Note: someone will need to regenerate the PDF.  I tried to do so using an open-source PDF creator, 
      - but the resulting file was larger than the one produced by Distiller.
  * Plotting
    + Amended r18, which didn't delete addBubbles.r (NB 111214)
    + Incorporated addBubbles() into PBSmapping.R (NB 111214)
      - Added addBubbles() to PBSmapping.R and made many changes including completely reformatting all of the code,
      - improving the comments, changing some of the logic, and addressing bugs.
      - The bugs included (a) testing floating-point equality using ==, which would result in inconsistent behaviour and 
      - (b) sizing bubbles in a way that that was inconsistent with the documentation.
  * C code
    + Changed EOL character from \r\n to \n for polygons.c (NB 111214)
      - When running R CMD CHECK, the script complained about the end-of-line character for this particular file.
      - I've changed the character to eliminate the warning.
  * Documentation
    + namespace requires the use of '.onLoad' instead of '.First.lib'. (RH 111109)
    + R-2.14.0 now requires all packages to have a namespace.  (RH 111109)
    + Added the UG document (PBSmapping-UG.doc) to a 'documentation' folder under 'trunk' in the SVN repository. (RH 111003)
    + Changed status of Issue 11 to 'Started'  - incorporate PBSmapping protocols into function 'addBubbles'. (NB 111002)
    + Changed status of Issue 9  to 'Accepted' - user is possibly talking about 'MGRJ' latitude bands. (NB 111002)
    + Changed status of Issue 10 to 'Accepted' - word change needed in UG. (NB 111002)
    + Changed status of Issue 8  to 'Invalid'  - UG appears to be unlocked now. (NB 111002)
    + Changed status of Issue 1  to 'Invalid'  - segmentation fault not reproducible and user never supplied code. (NB 111002)
    + Improved path expansion in 'importShapefile' using R's 'path.expand' and ' normalizePath'. (NB 111002)
    + Bumped up the version number to distinguish the revisions under way from the version currently on CRAN. (RH 110908)
  * Computational
    + Fixed a bug in appendPolys() and update the function's documentation. (NB 110905)
      - Within appendPolys(), a reference to polys used parentheses rather than brackets causing R 
      - to look for a non-existent polys function rather than the argument.
      - The documentation for the function was also updated to clarify the determination of the polygon's PID.

2.61  2010-06-23  [RH]

    + POSTED ON CRAN.

2.087  2006-08-25  [NB]
  * Documentation
    + RS_Docs/calcVoronoi.Rd: Added comments about setting the "projection" and "zone" attributes.
  * Computational
    + RS_Source/PBSmapping 'calcVoronoi()': No longer uses the attributes "projection" and "zone"
      - from the input data set.  Instead, sets "projection" to 1 and "zone" to NULL; these
      - values are more appropriate for the result.

2.086  2006-08-15  [NB]
  * Computational
    + RS_Source/PBSmapping '.addCorners()': Cleaned up the code. 
    + 'calcVoronoi()': Cleaned up the code.

    + RS_Docs/dividePolys.Rd: Minor updates.
    + RS_Docs/combinePolys.Rd: Minor updates.
  * Plotting
    + RS_Source/PBSmapping 'addPolys()': Identified and corrected two bugs that caused errors 
      - in S-PLUS re: the "colHoles" argument.  One bug involved a difference between R/S-PLUS
      - polygon commands, where the S-PLUS version fails when given less than 3 points.
      - The other involved the code 'pProps$colHoles[is.na(pProps$colHoles)] <- "transparent"';
      - which would convert the 'colHoles' element to a character vector even if it made no replacements.
    + '.insertNAs()': Created function with a similar _purpose_ as the old 'insertNAs()' function 
      - in 'addLines()' and 'addPolys()'.  This function replaces it, operates drastically different, and 
      - is faster (in one test in R, ~11 seconds for 'plotMap(nepacLLhigh)' compared to ~77 seconds previously).

2.082  2006-07-19  [NB]
  * Documentation
    + RS_Docs/calcVoronoi.Rd: Created a better example based on [RH]'s code/suggestion.
  * Computational

      - when a polygon contained more than two points on a boundary.

2.081  2006-07-18  [NB]
  * Computational
    + RS_Source/PBSmapping '.checkProjection()': Updated error message since it can compare 
      - the projection of non-PolySet with that of a plot region.
  * Plotting
    + 'addLabels()': Identified and fixed bug where EventData containing a PID/SID column 
      - would incorrectly be recognized as PolyData.
  * Object-related
    + Removed message when 'fullValidation' == T : (is.EventData, is.LocationSet, is.PolyData, is.PolySet)
    + Added a check for "data frames" to better support conversions between PBS Mapping data types:
      - ('as.EventData()', 'as.LocationSet()', 'as.PolyData()', 'as.PolySet()').
  * Documentation
    + RS_Docs/importShapefile.Rd: Cleaned up documentation and expanded it for clarity.

  * Computational
    + RS_Source/PBSmapping 'calcVoronoi()': Added warning for data of an "LL" projection.
    + RS_Source/PBSmapping 'calcVoronoi()': Added argument "close = TRUE".
      - When TRUE, calls "closePolys" to close the polygons (i.e., corners).

2.071  2006-07-10  [NB]
  * Documentation
    + RS_Docs/combinePolys.Rd: Created documentation for new function.

    + RS_Docs/calcVoronoi.Rd: Created.
  * Import
    + 'importShapefile()': Rewrote so that it depends only on the C code included with  "maptools" and nothing else.
      - It's now much faster as it no longer converts to Spatial classes first. It still supports holes for PolySets.
    + 'importShapefileDBF()': Updated/simplified since DBF files contain one record per PID/EID.
      - No longer reads in the shapefile to create the indices.

2.066  2006-07-06  [NB]

    + C/Makefile: Added code that attempts to detect R < 2.3.0  to account for 
      - the new DLL build procedure. No longer defines the CYG_DIR and R_DIR variables;
      - instead, it expects them to be set in an environment variable.
    + Added new targets (depR and depCygwin) to check whether the appropriate environment variables are defined.

2.06  2006-05-17  [NB]
  * Computational
    + RS_Source/PBSmapping '.getGridPars()': Replaced the call to 'identical()' with
      - '!is.character(all.equal())' because S-PLUS 2000 lacks an 'identical' function.

      - Will make similar replacements in the dependent files.
    + Checked GPC functions to ensure appropriate types were being passed into the GPC,
      - because I won't make similar replacements within that module

  * R code
    + Removed automatic calculation of `mgp' from .addAxis and .addLabels

0.99  2003-12-22  [NB]
  * Computational
    + Bug fix: previously, 'clip()' assumed that if the first vertex in a polygon was not equal to 1, then the 
      - polygon must be a hole; now, it looks at the first two vertices to determine increasing or decreasing order.

0.985  2003-12-20  [NB]
  * R code
    + In .createPolyProps(), changed codes(ordered(...)) to as.integer(ordered(...)) to stop the related 'deprecated' error  message.
