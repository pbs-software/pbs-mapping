-----------------------------------

2.70.1 (2016-04-04)
  • Added a new function `addCompass' that can add a compass rose to a map. (RH 160401)
  • Added a new function `calcGCdist' to calculate great-circle distance. (RH 160401)
  • Updated `PBSmappingIntro.Rnw' (RH 160331)

2.70.0 (2015-08-12)
  - New version format x.y.z
  - Changed 2.69 to 2.70.0

2.69  2015-04-23
  - Last minute updates before another attempt to post on CRAN. (RH 150423)
  - Addressed warning when DEBUG == 1 regarding signed/unsigned comparison. (NB 150409)
  - Removed use of the token pasting operator (##). (NB 150409)
  - Modified `joinPolys.Rd' to illustrate the `DIFF' operation between polyA (A,B) and polyB (C,D). (RH 150330)
  - Updated `PBSmapping-UG.pdf' (and no longer includes Rd appendix because easily available on CRAN). (RH 150224)
  - Declared S3methods for `print' and `summary' in the NAMESPACE file, as required by CRAN. (RH 150217)
  - Updated `importGSHHS.Rd' to reflect changes made to function and to give 20 examples for various aprts of world. (RH 150216)
  - Modified extensively `importGSHHS' to deal with various problems encountered by users (wrapping, border problems, etc.). (RH 150212)
  - Modified `refocusWorld' to return the `xlim' used in the refocus as an attribute called `rf.xlim' (for use in `importGSHHS'). (RH 150211)
  - Updated Clipper to 6.2.1 and added (disabled) dbg output to clipperWrapper.cpp. (NB 150207)
	We received a bug report regarding joinPolys.  After significant testing/tracing, the bug appears to exist within Clipper 5.1.6.
	Rather than revert to 5.1.4, this commit upgrades Clipper to 6.2.1.
  - Bumped up version for next posting to CRAN in 2015.

2.68  2015-01-22
  - Fixed some broken hyperlinks and merged `nepacLL.Rd', `nepacLLhigh.Rd', `worldLL.Rd', and `worldLLhigh.Rd' into `nepacLL.Rd' using aliases. (RH 150122)
  - Ignored R CMD check: ``... used in a situation where it does not exist'' -- identified as a temporary bug in R-devel by Duncan Murdoch:
	http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/R-CMD-check-quot-quot-used-in-a-situation-where-it-does-not-exist-td4701779.html
  - Resolved missing line feed in `Makefile'; converted format from DOS to UNIX for `Makefile' and `*.cpp' files in `/inst/Utils'. (NB 150114)
  - Eliminated warning when compiling `clipper.cpp'. (NB 150112)
	Commented out an unused variable declared within `clipper.cpp'. This commit turns that declaration into a comment to eliminate the warning.
  - Added namespace when calling `deldir' and `read.dbf'. (NB 150109)
	PBSmapping calls `deldir' (package deldir) and `read.dbf' (package foreign),and for each, the code now specifies the namespace.
  - Updated clipper library from 5.1.4 to 5.1.6. (NB 150109)
  - Added `SystemRequirements: C++11' to the DESCRIPTION file to alert user that compilation and linking should be done with a C++11 compiler. (NB 150109)
	The clipper library used by PBSmapping operates on coordinates stored as integers, and for those integers, it uses the "long long" type that 
	was introduced in the C++11 standard. When an R package requires C++11 features, the DESCRIPTION file must state this requirement.
  - Bumped up version for next posting to CRAN in 2015.

2.67  2014-12-15
  - Changed line in `clipperWrapper.cpp' from `ulong64 val = llabs(*f++);' to `ulong64 val = (ulong64)fabs(*f++);' (NB 141217)
	The C compiler 'clang' with -Wall reports that PBSmapping is misusing the C function abs in their code: see
	http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Portable-C-and-C_002b_002b-code
  - Added Nicholas J. Lewin-Koh and Roger Bivand as authors because we use their C code `Rshapeget' for the function `importShapefile'. (RH 141217)
  - Added new argument `includeBdry' to functions `findCells' and `findPolys' -- see Issue 33. (RH 141215)
  - Incorporated temporary fix for borders in function `importGSHHS' until more robust solution is found. (RH 140623)
  - Jon requested that Rowan becomes the package Maintainer. (RH 140327)
  - Bumped up version for next posting to CRAN using builds under R-3.0.3 (RH 140320)

2.66  2014-03-10
  - Fixed bug in `joinPolys` identified by Andrea Romualdi (see Issue 31). (RH 140310)
  - Modified gshhs.h to address Issue 30. (JTS 140218)
  - Modified the function `importShapefile` to treat shape types (5,15,25) like 5, (3,13,23) like 3, and (1,11,21) like 1. (RH 131220)
	See `ESRI Shapefile Technical Description: An ESRI White Paper—July 1998` for more details.
  - Updated `PBSmapping-UG.pdf` to reflect the new website for GSHHS, now called GSHHG. (RH 130503)
  - Added Authors to DESCRIPTION file (based on C source code annotations); updated copyright dates. (RH 130503)
  - Modified User's Guide. (RH 130501)
  - Moved `PBSmapping-Intro.Rnw` to `vignettes` directory. (RH 130501)

2.65  2013-04-22
  - Added temporary function `.addAxis2` to address Issue 20 until NB updates code. (RH 130422)
  - Updated the User's Guide. (RH 130411)
  - Modified example code in Rd files to use the new environment `.PBSmapEnv`. (RH 130410)
  - Modified the `print` method to look for `.PBSmapEnv$PBSprint` in addition to a global `PBSprint`. (RH 130410)
  - Added new temporary working environment called `.PBSmapEnv`. (RH 130410)
  - Address odd joinPolys output observed in Puget Sound. (NB 130328)
  - Updated Clipper from 5.1.3 to 5.1.4. (NB 130328)
  - Change Clipper line endings from DOS (\r\n) to UNIX (\n). (NB 130323)
  - Replaced the General Polygon Clipper (GPC) library with Clipper. (NB 130323)
  - Fix compilation problem on Windows. (NB 130323)

  - Finalised some tweaks to the files DESCRIPTION and LICENSE. (RH 121127)
  - Updated 'PBSmapping-UG.pdf' slightly and set the resolution to 150 dpi. (RH 121126)
  - Bumped up version for yet another submission to CRAN.

2.63  2012-11-19
  - Submitted to CRAN and rejected by Brian Ripley who wants to see Alan Murta as a co-author. (JTS 121119)
  - Provided licensing information that protects the General Polygon Clipper (GPC) library. (RH 121116)
  - Wrapped calls to foreign C code in 'eval(parse(text=""))' to bypass the latest R check nonsense. (RH 121102)
  - Changed Jon's email address to schnutej-dfo@shaw.ca (RH 121101)
  - Modified function 'placeHoles' to .Call("R_point_in_polygon_sp", ..., PACKAGE="sp"); still need to load package 'sp'. (RH 120405)
  - Modified function 'importShapefile' to optionally use 'placeHoles' for fixing mismatched holes and solids. (RH 120404)
  - Added new function 'placeHoles' to fix problem of mismatched holes and solids from ArcView. (RH 120404)
  - Bumped up the version number to distinguish the revisions under way from the version currently on CRAN. (RH 120404)

2.62  2012-03-01
  - Fixed source code problems identified by Brian Ripley. (NB 120301)
	Compiled code should not call functions which might terminate R nor write to stdout/stderr instead of to the console.
	The detected symbols are linked into the code but might come from libraries and not actually be called.
	Please fix (especially the call to exit).
  - Resolved partial argument matching in functions identified by Brian Ripley. (RH 120301)
  - Cleaned up various files in preparation for submission to CRAN. (RH 120229)
  - Added further conditional compilation to gshhs.[ch] to address warnings in Windows OS. (NB 120228)
  - Rewrote GSHHS import functionality and revised some related functions. (NB 120225)
	This rather large commit completely rewrites GSHHS functionality and provides a number of immediate advantages:
	  (a) support for the latest (2.20) GSHHS binary files, 
	  (b) support for multiple levels, e.g., lakes, islands, and ponds, within a single import with suitable ordering of polygons and their holes, 
	  (c) support for lines, e.g., rivers and borders, 
	  (d) more robust support functions, e.g., .fixGSHHSworld, and finally, 
	  (e) a more maintainable approach to GSHHS integration.
	Some specific changes include:
	(1) .fixGSHHSworld (PBSmapping.r)
	    -> support world maps centred on 0 in addition to 180 degrees.
	(2) importGSHHS (PBSmapping.r)
	    -> revised arguments to support the new behaviour (above);
	    -> process argument gshhsDB to support paths relative to home directories;
	    -> moved handling of minVerts from R to C;
	    -> moved clipping from C to R (to simplify C code);
	    -> ordered PIDs/SIDs to support holes.
	(3) convGSHHS.c
	    -> rewrote completely so that it is distinct from gshhs.c.
	(4) gshhs.c
	    -> added slight revisions to support calls to routines in convGSHHS.c.
	(5) gshhs.h
	    -> added slight revisions to support calls to routines in convGSHHS.c.
	(6) importGSHHS.Rd
	    -> revised to match the changes to the code.
  - Reduced whitespace and break long lines in 'convGSHHS.c'. (NB 120224)
  - Corrected spelling mistakes in Rd documentation. (NB 120224)
  - Added support for S hemisphere to LL <=> UTM conversion (convUL). (NB 120224)
	Added support for the southern hemisphere to convUL (and supporting functions) by adding a new 
	"southern" argument.  By default, the argument is NULL because detection is automatic when the 
	source is LL. For UTM source data, the default is FALSE because we typically work within the northern hemisphere.
	Added the ability to compile conversions.c (the supporting C code) as a stand-alone application.  
	When executed, the stand-alone executable performs a number of conversions that help validate the algorithm.
  - Improved long/lat <=> UTM conversions; updated documentation ( Issue #9 ). (NB 120223)
	Issue #9  noted erroneous results given data that spanned more than one zone to the right/left 
	of the intended central zone.  This update improves our implementation by correcting a number of 
	(implementation) errors (described below), but the problem still persists.
	The earlier (2001) implementation had a number of optimizations that made it terribly difficult 
	to verify the code against the published algorithm and inspecting the implementation revealed some errors:
	(1) the calculation of 'n' used scaled 'a'/'b' rather than original 'a'/'b',
	(2) the calculation of 'e^2' used scaled 'a'/'b' rather than original 'a'/'b', and
	(3) the calculation of 'm' was not iterative as suggested in the algorithm.
	This new version more closely matches the published algorithm and is consequently easy to verify.
	The performance is similar to the old algorithm (faster in some cases, slower in others).
  - Re-compressed rda files; changed namespace to explicitly export; changed dependency to R (>= 2.10). (RH 111221)
  - Fixed missing longitude/latitude X/Y labels on Mac OS X. (NB 111220)
	When plotting a longitude/latitude PolySet on Mac OS X, the X/Y labels wouldn't plot.
	Our earlier use of \260 for the degree sign depends on the underlying character set, so it isn't sufficiently portable.
	Let's hope the current approach works a little better...
  - Updated .addAxis(...) to address layout(...) incompatibility. (NB 111220)
	.addAxis(...) would backup/restore "omi" and "mfg", which would impact how layout(...) handles multiple plots.
	This behaviour is unnecessary in the current version of R, so it has been removed.
  - Added refocusWorld() to help plot maps centred on the mid-Atlantic ( issue #4 ). (NB 111219)
	This new function accepts a PolySet containing one or more polygons with X-coordinates that collectively span 
	approximately 360 degrees. 
	The function effectively joins the PolySet into a cylinder and then splits it at an arbitrary longitude according
	to the user-specified limits.  
	Modifications in the resulting PolySet are restricted to shifting X-coordinates by +/- multiples of 360 degrees,
	and instead of clipping polygons, the return value simply omits out-of-range polygons.
  - Fixed indenting. (NB 111219)
  - Clarified use of "latter" on page 13 of UG (issue #10). (NB 111214)
	Note: someone will need to regenerate the PDF.  I tried to do so using an open-source PDF creator, 
	but the resulting file was larger than the one produced by Distiller.
  - Amended r18, which didn't delete addBubbles.r (NB 111214)
  - Incorporated addBubbles() into PBSmapping.R (NB 111214)
	Added addBubbles() to PBSmapping.R and made many changes including completely reformatting all of the code,
	improving the comments, changing some of the logic, and addressing bugs.
	The bugs included (a) testing floating-point equality using ==, which would result in inconsistent behaviour and 
	(b) sizing bubbles in a way that that was inconsistent with the documentation.
  - Changed EOL character from \r\n to \n for polygons.c (NB 111214)
	When running R CMD CHECK, the script complained about the end-of-line character for this particular file.
	I've changed the character to eliminate the warning.
  - namespace requires the use of '.onLoad' instead of '.First.lib'. (RH 111109)
  - R-2.14.0 now requires all packages to have a namespace.  (RH 111109)
  - Added the UG document (PBSmapping-UG.doc) to a 'documentation' folder under 'trunk' in the SVN repository. (RH 111003)
  - Changed status of Issue 11 to 'Started'  - incorporate PBSmapping protocols into function 'addBubbles'. (NB 111002)
  - Changed status of Issue 9  to 'Accepted' - user is possibly talking about 'MGRJ' latitude bands. (NB 111002)
  - Changed status of Issue 10 to 'Accepted' - word change needed in UG. (NB 111002)
  - Changed status of Issue 8  to 'Invalid'  - UG appears to be unlocked now. (NB 111002)
  - Changed status of Issue 1  to 'Invalid'  - segmentation fault not reproducible and user never supplied code. (NB 111002)
  - Improved path expansion in 'importShapefile' using R's 'path.expand' and ' normalizePath'. (NB 111002)
  - Bumped up the version number to distinguish the revisions under way from the version currently on CRAN. (RH 110908)
  - Fixed a bug in appendPolys() and update the function's documentation. (NB 110905)
	Within appendPolys(), a reference to polys used parentheses rather than brackets causing R 
	to look for a non-existent polys function rather than the argument.
	The documentation for the function was also updated to clarify the determination of the polygon's PID.

  - Changed 'convUL.Rd' to specify that UTM coordinates are in kilometres.
  - Re-saved the data files using 'save("data",file="data.rda")'.Compresses binary files more than earlier saves.

2.10b  2007-01-03  Jon
   - Built for R only, with first attempts to remove traces of S-PLUS.

2.10a  2006-11-14  Nick
  - R/PBSmapping.R 'importShapefile()': Eliminated a bug that caused some 
	"reef" shapefiles not to load.  It occurred when no POS entries needed reversing.

2.08g  2006-08-25  Nick
  - RS_Docs/calcVoronoi.Rd: Added comments about setting the "projection" and "zone" attributes.
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping 'calcVoronoi()': No longer uses the attributes "projection" and "zone"
	from the input data set.  Instead, sets "projection" to 1 and "zone" to NULL; these
	values are more appropriate for the result.

2.08f  2006-08-15  Nick

  - C/common/polygons.c 'convexHull()': Fixed a (trivial) bug in 'calcConvexHull()'
	that caused it to produce incorrect (bizarre) results.
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping '.addCorners()': Added function.

2.08d  2006-08-04  Nick
  - RS_Docs/calcVoronoi.Rd: Updated to reflect the removed "close" argument.
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping 'calcVoronoi()': Removed 'close' argument.

2.08c  2006-07-20  Nick
  - RS_Docs/dividePolys.Rd: Minor updates.
  - RS_Docs/combinePolys.Rd: Minor updates.
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping 'addPolys()': Identified and corrected two bugs that caused errors 
	in S-PLUS re: the "colHoles" argument.  One bug involved a difference between R/S-PLUS
	polygon commands, where the S-PLUS version fails when given less than 3 points.
	The other involved the code 'pProps$colHoles[is.na(pProps$colHoles)] <- "transparent"';
	which would convert the 'colHoles' element to a character vector even if it made no replacements.
  - '.insertNAs()': Created function with a similar _purpose_ as the old 'insertNAs()' function 
	in 'addLines()' and 'addPolys()'.  This function replaces it, operates drastically different, and 
	is faster (in one test in R, ~11 seconds for 'plotMap(nepacLLhigh)' compared to ~77 seconds previously).

2.08b  2006-07-19  Nick
  - RS_Docs/calcVoronoi.Rd: Created a better example based on Rowan's code/suggestion.
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping 'calcVoronoi()': Corrected bug where the function would fail 
	when a polygon contained more than two points on a boundary.

2.08a  2006-07-18  Nick
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping '.checkProjection()': Updated error message since it can compare 
	the projection of non-PolySet with that of a plot region.
  - 'addLabels()': Identified and fixed bug where EventData containing a PID/SID column 
	would incorrectly be recognized as PolyData.
  - Removed message when 'fullValidation' == T : (is.EventData, is.LocationSet, is.PolyData, is.PolySet)
  - Added a check for "data frames" to better support conversions between PBS Mapping data types:
	('as.EventData()', 'as.LocationSet()', 'as.PolyData()', 'as.PolySet()').
  - RS_Docs/importShapefile.Rd: Cleaned up documentation and expanded it for clarity.

2.08  2006-07-17  Nick
  - R_Other/DESCRIPTION (Suggests): Removed suggests for 'sp' since not (yet) suggested.
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping '.pbsproj()': Commented out to make release 2.08.

  - RS_Source/PBSmapping 'calcVoronoi()': Added warning for data of an "LL" projection.
  - RS_Docs/calcVoronoi.Rd: Added "close" argument to match code.
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping 'calcVoronoi()': Added argument "close = TRUE".
	When TRUE, calls "closePolys" to close the polygons (i.e., corners).

2.07a  2006-07-10  Nick
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping 'dividePolys()': Created new function.
  - RS_Docs/combinePolys.Rd: Created documentation for new function.

2.07  2006-07-07  Nick
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping 'SpatialPolygons2PolySet()': Commented out to make release 2.07.
  - 'SpatialLines2PolySet()': Commented out to make release 2.07.
  - 'SpatialPoints2EventData()': Commented out to make release 2.07.
  - RS_Docs/importShapefileDBF.Rd: Created.
  - RS_Docs/importShapefile.Rd: Created.
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping '.checkRDeps()': Made hidden by renaming from 'checkRDeps()'; 
	updated other functions to reflect the change.
  - 'importShapefile()': Rewrote so that it depends only on the C code included with  "maptools" and nothing else.
	It's now much faster as it no longer converts to Spatial classes first. It still supports holes for PolySets.
  - 'importShapefileDBF()': Updated/simplified since DBF files contain one record per PID/EID.
	No longer reads in the shapefile to create the indices.
  - RS_Docs/calcConvexHull.Rd: Updated description of "xydata" to improve clarity.
  - RS_Docs/calcVoronoi.Rd: Created.

2.06f  2006-07-06  Nick

  - RS_Docs/plotMap.Rd: Added "colHoles" argument.
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping (addPolys): Finished adding a first version of the "colHoles" argument.
  - 'locatePolys()': If a variable named "SID" existed before the call, it would break the function. Fixed.

2.06d  2006-07-04  Nick
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping 'findCells()': Removed final call to 'as.LocationSet()' to 
	improve performance and added code to manually set the class.
  - 'plotMap()': Added "colHoles" argument for hole colours and included it in the call to '.plotMaps()'.
  - 'plotPolys()': Added "colHoles" argument and added it in the call to '.plotMaps()'.
  - '.plotMaps()': Added "colHoles" argument and included it in the call to 'addPolys()'.
  - 'addPolys()': Added "colHoles" argument.
  - '.preparePolyProps()': Simplified the code.

2.06c  2006-06-21  Nick

  - '.getBasename()': Created function.

2.06a  2006-05-24  Nick
  - C/Makefile: Added code that attempts to detect R < 2.3.0  to account for 
	the new DLL build procedure. No longer defines the CYG_DIR and R_DIR variables;
	instead, it expects them to be set in an environment variable.
  - Added new targets (depR and depCygwin) to check whether the appropriate environment variables are defined.

2.06  2006-05-17  Nick
  - SPLUS6.sh: Added the path to the S-PLUS 6.2 CHAPTER command.
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping '.getGridPars()': Replaced the call to 'identical()' with
	'!is.character(all.equal())' because S-PLUS 2000 lacks an 'identical' function.
  - POSTED ON CRAN.

2.05  2006-05-10  Nick
  - RS_Docs/makeGrid.Rd: Clarified the meaning of 'i' and 'j' in the details section.
	Corrected an off-by-one error with 'm' and 'n' in the details section.
  - RS_Docs/findPolys.Rd: Updated to reflect renaming the 'avg' argument to 'maxRows'.
  - RS_Source/PBSmapping 'findPolys()': Renamed the argument 'avg' to 'maxRows' so that 
	the user can now enter the estimated number of  rows in the output. 
	Behavior is consistent with 'joinPolys()', which has a 'maxVerts' argument.
  - 'findPolys()': Updated the error messages to match the 'maxRows' argument.
  - 'joinPolys()': Updated the error messages to match the 'maxVerts' argument.
  - 'joinPolys()': Removed dead code where it formerly calculated 'outCapacity'.
  - POSTED ON CRAN.

2.04  2004-11-14  Nick
  - Replaced all instances of long with PBSINT to quickly support R's use of 'int' rather than 'long'.
	Will make similar replacements in the dependent files.
  - Checked GPC functions to ensure appropriate types were being passed into the GPC,
	because I won't make similar replacements within that module
  - POSTED ON CRAN.

2.03  2005-06-01  Nick
  - POSTED ON CRAN.

2.02  2004-11-18  Nick

1.99  2004-07-29  Nick
  - Updated 'joinPolys()' to use existing PIDs when either 'polysA' or 'polysB' contains only one "generic" polygon

1.98  2004-07-28  Nick
  - Rewrote 'joinPolys()' and added several functions ('gpcOutputPoly()', 'gpcCreatePoly()')
	to support it; the code is much cleaner (and more powerful now).

1.93  2004-07-21  Nick

1.92  2004-07-18  Nick

1.91  2004-07-12  Nick

1.90d  2004-07-05  Nick
  - Renamed 'convexHull()' to 'calcConvexHull()';
	it called 'calcConvexHull()', and renamed this call to 'convexHull()'.

1.90c  2004-06-30  Nick
  - Added 'isConvex()'
  - Added 'nPolyIntersects()'

1.90b  2004-06-29  Nick
  - Added 'isRetrace()' to support 'isIntersecting()'.
  - Added 'lineIntersect()' to support 'isIntersecting()'.

1.90a  2004-06-28  Nick

1.90  2004-06-22  Nick

1.80  2004-06-21  Nick
  - Changed 'calcArea()' to match new interface for 'calcPolyArea()'; 
	can now return negative areas for holes; substantially simplified function.

1.70  2004-06-18  Nick
  - Removed 'fixPOS()' and 'integrateHoles()'.

1.60  2004-06-17  Nick
  - Cleaning
  - Added 'rollupPolys()' to replace 'fixPOS()' and 'integrateHoles()' - but it does much more than those two.

1.50  2004-06-16  Nick
  - Adjusted paths to #include's

1.40  2004-06-15  Nick
  - Renamed 'integrateHoles()' to 'mergePolys()';
	now merges in all SIDs when specified as well as those representing holes.
  - Fixed huge memory leak and bug in 'joinPolys()' -- the clip polygon wasn't handled correctly.

1.30  2004-06-14  Nick

1.20d  2004-06-10  Nick
  - Gave 'fixPOS()' the ability to update X/Y values so that it can make polygons that follow
	the GIS standards for clockwise/counter-clockwise.
  - Renamed 'calcPolygonArea()' to 'calcPolyArea()'

1.20c  2004-06-09  Nick
  - Performed preliminary memory tests on all functions, and none appeared to have memory leaks.
  - Added 'calcOrientation()' to determine whether vertices are clockwise or counter-clockwise.

1.20b  2004-06-08  Nick
  - Added 'thickenPolys()' (only supports UTM).

1.20a  2004-06-02  Nick
  - Updated 'thinPolys()' to support UTM.

1.20  2004-05-30  Nick

1.10c  2004-05-26  Nick
  - Fixed huge memory leaks in 'joinPolys()'.
  - Added support for all R-accessible functions to interface with MemCheckDeluxe.

1.10b  2004-05-24  Nick
  - Fixed huge bug in 'joinPolys()', where an error would be signalled where one didn't really exist
	(check if all holes were processed was placed in the wrong spot...).

1.10a  2004-05-20  Nick
  - Added 'convexHull()'

1.10  2004-05-16  Nick

1.00e  2004-05-12  Nick
  - Renamed 'clipToPoly()' to 'joinPolys()'.
  - Extensively cleaned up 'joinPolys()' code.
  - Added 'extern gpc_success' to catch errors that occur within GPC.
  - Discovered setjmp.h (setjmp() and longjmp())!!!
	Now I can reliably detect memory allocation errors that occur in GPC!!!

1.00d  2004-05-11  Nick
  - Renamed 'clipPoly()' to 'clipToPoly()'.

1.00c  2004-05-10  Nick
  - Continued use of the Greiner/Hormann polygon clip routine would require accounting for numerous special cases;
	switching to the gpc (General Polygon Clipper) library.
  - Fully implemented an interface to the gpc library (holes and all).
  - We will need to rename the R function from 'clipPoly' to something more intuitive.

1.00b  2004-05-08  Nick
  - Added 'clipPoly()' function to clip a polygon against another polygon.

1.00a  2004-05-04  Nick

1.00  2004-01-04  Nick
  - Cosmetic changes to the code.

0.99  2003-12-22  Nick
  - Bug fix: previously, 'clip()' assumed that if the first vertex in a polygon was not equal to 1, then the 
	polygon must be a hole; now, it looks at the first two vertices to determine increasing or decreasing order.

0.98  2003-08-15  Nick
  - Renamed functions:
	'ulConv()' --> 'convUL()'
	'locateEvents()' --> 'findPolys()'
	'clipPolys()' --> 'clip()'

0.97  2003-08-14  Nick

  - Moved 'clipPolygon' to polygons.c/.h

0.93  2003-07-21  Nick
  - Removed 'lines_intersect()' from the file (not used).
  - Moved 'calcPolygonArea' to its own files, polygons.c/.h
  - In time, polygon clipping should be moved to the polygons.c/.h files.

0.92  2003-07-16  Nick
  - Changed the interface to 'fixPOS()' so that it will take floating-point POSs as input.
  - Moved 'fixBound()' to R.
