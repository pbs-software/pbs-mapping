Description: This software has evolved from fisheries research conducted at the
   Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in `Nanaimo', British Columbia, Canada. It
   extends the R language to include two-dimensional plotting features similar
   to those commonly available in a Geographic Information System (GIS).
   Embedded C code speeds algorithms from computational geometry, such as
   finding polygons that contain specified point events or converting between
   longitude-latitude and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.
   Additionally, we include `C++' code developed by Angus Johnson for the `Clipper'
   library. Also included are data for a global shoreline and other
   data sets in the public domain. The R directory `.../library/PBSmapping/doc'
   offers a complete user's guide, which should be consulted to use package
   functions effectively.
